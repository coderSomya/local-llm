Born on April 15, 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, and dying on September 18, 1783, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, he is considered one of the greatest mathematicians in history.\n\nEuler's work spans a wide range of mathematical areas including:\n\n- **Mathematics**: He introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, especially for mathematical functions. Some of his famous contributions include:\n  - The letter \\( e \\) to represent the base of the natural logarithm.\n  - The symbol \\( i \\) for the imaginary unit.\n  - The Greek letter \\( \\pi \\) to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.\n\n- **Physics**: He made significant advances in the fields of mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, and astronomy. One of his most famous contributions is Euler's formula in complex analysis: \\( e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x \\).\n\n- **Graph Theory**: Euler solved the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, which led to the birth of graph theory.\n\nEuler was prolific; he wrote more than 800 books and papers during his lifetime. Despite losing his sight in one eye early on and later going almost totally blind, he continued to produce work of high quality. His contributions have had a lasting impact on many fields of mathematics and science."}
